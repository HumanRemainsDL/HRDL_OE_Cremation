Guthlac A 663aâ€“79a Translation from M Clayton 2013

You imagined and wished, perverse as you are, that you would be like the creator in glory. It turned out worse for you there, when the ruler furiously plunged you into that dark torment where a pyre was then kindled for you, tainted with venom, where, by his solemn judgment, joy, the companionship of angels, was taken away. Now and forever, it must always be so, that you will be subject to damnation, the surging flame, no blessing at all. Cut off from glory, you who are full of sins need not hope that you will be able to thrust me with your treacherous cunning ignominiously into darkness or fling me in a blaze of fire down into the house of hell where a home has been made for you, black eternal night, distress without end, the grim destruction of the soul.
