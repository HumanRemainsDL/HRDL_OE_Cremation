Beowulf 1107a–1120a
The funeral fire was prepared,      and Ingui's gold, raised from the hoard;      the War-Scyldings' best battle-man was ready on the bier; at the funeral-pyre was      easily seen the blood-stained mail-shirt, the swine all-golden, the boar hard as iron,      the prince had many destroyed by wounds; great men had fallen in slaughter; Then Hildeburh ordered her own son to be entrusted to the flames at Hnæf’s pyre, their bone-vessels burn and be placed on the blaze, at his uncle’s side. The battle-smoke rose up, curled to the clouds, the greatest of slaughter-fires roared before the grave-mound.
