Genesis A 2897a–2936b. Translation from D Anlezark 2011

Resolute, he then climbed up the steep hill with his heir, as the eternal one commanded him, until he stood on the summit of the high land in the place that the strong one, the covenant-faithful creator, showed him in words. He began then to load up the pyre, give life to the fire, and fettered the feet and hands of his son, and then lifted young Isaac onto the blaze, and then quickly grabbed the sword by the hilt — he intended to kill his son with his own hands, plunge his kinsman’s gore in the fire. Then the creator’s officer, a certain angel from above, cried out to Abraham in loud voice. Motionless he awaited the messenger’s speech and answered the angel. Then the glory-spirit of God quickly spoke to him from above, in words from the skies. “Dear Abraham, do not slay you own child, but pull the boy, your heir, living from the fire! The God of glory is pleased with him! Prince of Hebrews, by the holy land of the king of heaven you personally shall receive rewards, true spoils of victory, abundant gifts. The guardian of spirits will give you delights, because his peace and favor were dearer to you than your own son.” The fire continued to burn. The creator of humanking had delighted the heart of Abraham, Lot’s kinsman, when he returned to him his son, the living Isaac. Then the blessed man, haran’s brother, glanced over his shoulder, and saw there a ram not far from him, standing along, stuck in brambles. Abraham took it and lifted it onto the fire with great zeal, in place of his own son. Then he moved quickly with the sword, decorated the burnt offering, the smoking altar with ram’s blood, offered that oblation to God, sain thanks for the rewards and all the gifts that the Lord had given him, both early and late.
