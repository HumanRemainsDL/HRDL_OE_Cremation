Exodus 116a–124b Translation from D Anlezark 2011

A new night-watchman was needed to watch over the troops, so that the wasteland-fear, the hoary heath-terror, should not put an end to life with ocean storms’ sudden grasp. This scout had fiery locks, and lustrous beams of light; it threatened that army-throng with fire-terror, with hot flame so that in the wasteland it could incinerate the company, unless they, keen-spirited, obeyed Moses.
