Elene 945bâ€“52a Translation from R Bjork 2013

May you know more clearly that you unwisely have lost the brightest of lights and the love of the Lord, that fair delight, and on a bath of fire encompassed with tortures have since dwelled, burning on the pyre, and there always must, malevolent, suffer damnation, miseries without end.
