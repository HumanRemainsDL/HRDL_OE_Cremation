Phoenix 208b–40a Translation from C Jones 2012

When the gem of the skies in a summer season, hottest with the sun, shines across the shadows and performs its destiny, surveying the world, then the bird’s house becomes heated by the glowing sky. The herbs are warmed, the house of desire steams with sweet fragrance, then in flames that bird burns through the grip of the fire amid its nest. The pyre will be kindled. Then the torch engulfs the life-dreary house, the fierce one hurries, the fallow flame feeds upon it and the Phoenix burns, wise with passing years. Then the fire consumes the loaned life-house—it shall go traveling, the fated soul-hoard, when flesh and bone are lighted by the corpse-fire. Nevertheless the spirit soon comes for him, renewed after the appointed time, after those ashes begin to lock together after the flame’s wrack, contracting into a ball. Then the brightest nest will be purified, the brave house burned out by the pyre—the body will grow cool, the bone-vessel broken, and the flames die down. Then in the fire something like an apple soon is found in the ashes, and from that grows a worm, wonderfully fair, as if led forth out of an egg, glorious from the shell. Then it grows in the shadows, so that it first appears like an eagle’s chick, a fair bird in the making. Then further still, it flourishes in delight so that it bears something like the form of an old eagle, and after that, adorned with feathers such as he was at the start, blossoming brightly.
