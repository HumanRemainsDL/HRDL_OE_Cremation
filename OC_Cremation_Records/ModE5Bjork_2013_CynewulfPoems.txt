Elene 1281b–88a Translation from R Bjork 2013

Every speech-bearer must hear truth there through the judge’s mouth about every deed and for every word as well, be responsible for all folly spoken before, for presumptuous thoughts. Then into the embrace of the fire, he will divide into three each people who ever existed across the spacious ground. The steadfast in truth, the company of the blessed, the retinue of those eager for glory, will be uppermost on the pyre so that they, a host of the brave, may tolerate it and without distress easily endure. For them he will moderate the full light of the fire as it will be most pleasant for him, most easy to bear for them.
