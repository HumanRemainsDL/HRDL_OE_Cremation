Azarius 170b–a Translation from D Anlezark 2011

“I readily knew, guide of the nations, that for spiritual love we had bound for burning three young lads in the blazing beams of fire. I did not send four people there to their fate: that was not at all my own arrangement. Now they move about the hearth, the heat does not harm any of them, the flame of the furnace, but an angel is with them, they have a bright radiance; the blaze cannot harm his beautiful glory-raiment.” When the prince of the Chaldean swallowed those words, he went to the blaze, the arrogant man, so that he stood in front of the pyre. He then commanded the living men to come out of the flame and go before Nebuchadnezzar. The saints did not despise that, when they courageously obeyed the admonition of the earthly king, but they went from the fire, life unharmed, the miracle glorified, so that even their clothes were not damaged by the greedy hostility of the flames, but with spiritual love they crushed sin, and became victorious, wise in their minds, in their customs, and with prudence escaped the fire.
