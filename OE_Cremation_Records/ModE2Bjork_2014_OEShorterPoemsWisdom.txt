Fortunes of Men 42b Translation from R Bjork 2014

His name is cursed. Fire shall afflict one on the funeral pyre, the fearful flame will consume the doomed one; there separation from life happens quickly, the cruel ember reddens with blood; the woman weeps, she sees the flames swallow up her child.
