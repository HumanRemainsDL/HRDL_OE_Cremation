Christ II 318a–33b Translation from M Clayton 2013

The joy in mortal adornments shall be departed. Our share of living joy was long encircled by flooding waters and our wealth on earth. Then all those trappings must burn in the pyre and brightly shall the swift red flame rage— quickly it shall race throughout the wide world. The plains will crumble, the city-steads burst. The torches shall be on the move, kindling the ancient treasures without remorse, the most greedy of spirits, that men once kept so long as glory was theirs on the earth.
