Phoenix 499a–14b Translation from C Jones 2012

Through the Lord’s power dark death will be ended for the blessed. Nobly they shall turn, thronging in crowds, when this sin-working world shall burns in shame, kindled in the pyre. Everyone shall become fearful in their souls when the fire destroys this loaned land-wealth, the flames consuming all the treasures of earth, appled gold gripped greedily, speedily swallowed the adornments of this world. Then in that revelatory hour the fair and joyous symbol of that bird shall come into the light for all these men, when all that power shall be raised from the tombs, gathering up the bones and the body’s limbs alike, and the spirit of life before the knee of Christ.
