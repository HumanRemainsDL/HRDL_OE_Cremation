Elene 574a–88a Translation from R Bjork 2013

Angry, Elene made a formal speech and said to them: ‘I will tell you in truth, and on my life, this is not a lie, if you who stand before me persist longer in these falsehoods with old deceit, that a pyre, the hottest of fierce flames, will consume you on the hill, and the leaping fire will destroy your corpses because that life will be accounted in you worthy of death. You cannot prove those words true which you for a while now wrongly concealed in the corners of your sins, nor can you hide the event, obscure the deep power.’ Then they expected death, the pyre, and the end of life, and handed over there one very wise in songs who was known to his kinsmen by the name Judas; they gave him to the queen, called him singularly wise.
