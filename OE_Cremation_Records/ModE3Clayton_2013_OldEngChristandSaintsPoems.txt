Christ and Satan 805a–14b Translation from M Clayton 2013

The devils howled widely throughout their windy hall, bewailing their woes, their wickedness and deadly sin. There was a multitude there so immolated—that was all a very strong fate. Then was their lord, who had come first forth among the foot-soldiers, bound fast in fire and licking flame. That was an unceasing calamity. His thanes must also dwell there in that terrible homeland, not at all up there hearing in heaven that holy delight where they had often a lovely following upwards among the angels. They were not allowed to dwell with any of the good things, except for the fires of the abyss, and that cursed hall where there are woes and cries widely heard, and a gnashing of teeth, and the lamentations of men.
