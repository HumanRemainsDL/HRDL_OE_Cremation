Beowulf 2306bâ€“2323b
Then the day was departed to the joy of the wyrm;    he did not lie within the wall, (nor) wished to wait,    but with bale-fire set forth, infused with flame;    this beginning was terrible for the people in the land,    as it soon was upon their treasure-giver     painfully ended. Then the demon began    to spew flames, to burn bright houses;    the gleam of fire rose to the horror of the men;    nor there anything alive the hateful air-flier    wished to leave; the war-strength of that wyrm was     widely seen, the malice of the darkly cunning one    near and far, how the war-scather    the people of the Geats hated and humiliated;    back to his hoard he shot, the hidden lord-hall    ere the time of day; the inhabitants of the land had been     seized by flame, in blaze and in fire;    his barrow he trusted, his war-skill and his walls;    him this belief deceived.
