Exodus 397a–410b Translation from D Anlezark 2011

To that meeting place Abraham led his son Isaac. He lit a fire; the foremost soul-slayer was none the happier for that. He was willing to give the heir to the flame, the best of sons into the blaze of the pyre, he sweet son as a victory holocaust, his only successor on earth, his life’s comfort — as from that time he so experienced — a legacy to his people, an enduring hope. He made that known, when he seized the boy firmly in his hands — the illustrious one drew the ancient heirloom, the blade rasped loudly — that he did not consider the boy’s life-days dearer to him than obeying the king of heaven.
