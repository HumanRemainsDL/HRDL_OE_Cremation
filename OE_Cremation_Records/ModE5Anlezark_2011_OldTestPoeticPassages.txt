Daniel 224a–b Translation from D Anlezark 2011

Then the obstinate king became angry, he commanded the oven be heated for the extinction of the young men’s lives because they had denied his powers. When it was heated as it most cruelly could be with the terrible flame of fire, then he summoned the people there, and the guardian of Babylon, grim and bloody-minded, commanded God’s messengers to be bound. Then he commanded his servants to shove the youths, the young men, into the baleful blaze. He was ready who made their rescue. Although he had forced them so cruelly into the embrace of the fire’s flame, nevertheless the mighty sentinel of the creator saved their life there, just as many have heard tell.
