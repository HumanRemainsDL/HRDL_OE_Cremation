Phoenix 265ab–90b Translation from C Jones 2012

Then the bird, proud in feathers, will grow amidst the herbs. His spirit will be new and young, full of grace, when he gathers his limb-crafty body from the earth, that which the flame had destroyed before, the remains of the fire, cunningly collected the moldering bones after the pyre’s cruel grasp and then he soon brings together bone and cinder, the remains of the pyre, and then that dead corpse is adorned with herbs, fairly ornamented. Then he soon becomes eager to seek his own home. Then he grasps the fire’s leavings with his feet, seizing them with his talons, and soon his homeland, his sun-bright abode, he seeks delightfully, that blessed native country. All is renewed, the soul and the feather-home, just as he was at the start, when first God made him in that noble plain, triumph-fast. The Phoenix brings his own bones to that place, those that the torch’s surging enwrapped before by the pyre in that sheltering stead, and the ashes besides. Then battle-brave he buries all together, bone and cinder, on that island. He is renewed by the sign of the sun, when the light of the skies, the gladdest of gems, joy of noble stars, up over the spear-waves, gleams from the east.
