Phoenix 350a–67b Translation from C Jones 2012

And so the blessed bird after the hour of his death soon revisits his olden home, fairest on earth. The birds return from that captain sad-minded again to their homes. Then that noble one is young in his yard. God alone knows, the King Almighty, what sex he is: whether female or male. None of the kindred of men knows that, except the Measurer alone, how those facts are wonderful, the lovely and ancient decree of the bird’s gender. There the blessed one may enjoy his homeland, the welling waters within the wooded glade, dwelling upon the plain until a thousand winters have run. Then is the end of his life; the pyre will engulf him through kindled flame. Yet will it be awakened again miraculously and wonderfully back to life.
