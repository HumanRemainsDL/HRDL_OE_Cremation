Beowulf 3094bâ€“3100b
he spoke much on many things, old in his grief, and commanded me greet you all, bid that you build  in accord of your friend's deeds in the cremation place a high barrow, large and splendid, as he was of men a warrior most honoured throughout this wide earth, while he the prosperity of a city could enjoy.
